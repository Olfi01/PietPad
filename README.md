# PietPad

An editor, interpreter and debugger for the esoteric programming language Piet.

When I encountered Piet, I looked around the web a bit but found no particular IDE or similar that had everything I wanted for it, so I decided to write my own!

## Features
1. Easy-to-use editor for a Piet program
2. Interpreter and debugger for execution
3. Import and Export from and to .png files

## Piet
The implementation of the interpreter follows the original specifications for Piet (can be found [here](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html)).

## Download
The most recent installation file can be found [here](https://github.com/Olfi01/PietPad/releases).

### In conclusion: have fun!
